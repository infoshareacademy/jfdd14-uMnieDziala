### Our landing page will beautifully present you our Tripcity app product:
- at the very beginning there will be great photos from all over the Tricity (as above),
- to navigate our site you can use links in the navigation bar or use the mouse scroll,
- on the landing page you will also find the main functions of the Tipcity application,
- the Tripcity application can be used for free, but also after purchasing a subscription it receives additional functions. Therefore, the landing page has a subscription calculator that will easily calculate the cost of the subscription.
- if you like the Tripcity application you can always leave us your mail and we will inform you about new functionalities and promotions.
- I'd almost forget, we have a little surprise for you. If you leave us your email, we will thank you with "probably" the best video game in the Pomeranian province called "swim Hel(l)" ... good luck.
